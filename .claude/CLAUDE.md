- In all interactions and commit messages, be extremely concise and sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision.

## PR Comments

<pr-comment-rule>
When I say to add a comment to a PR with a TODO on it, use the checkbox markdown format to add the TODO. For instance:
<example>
- [ ] A description of the TODO goes here
</example>
</pr-comment-rule>

## Commit messages and Github PR descriptions and Issues

- Never include a reference to Claude code or the fact that the change in question was created with the assistance of Claude or AI. I pay for this service, and I do not consent to you using my work to advertise it.

## Github

- Your primary method for interacting with Github should be the Github CLI

## Git

- When creating branches, prefix them with "robbie/" to indicate that they're mine.

## Plans

- At the end of each plan, give me a list of unresolved questions, if any. Make the questions extremely concise. Sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision.

- If I tell you to store this plan in an issue, what I mean is this: make a Github issue containing the current plan, including all of the items you checked off the plan list. Add anything to that plan that will help Claude resume the plan by reading the Github issue from a fresh context window.
